# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Gamblignant

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A mod for the game Slay the Spire that adds a new character with a unique mechanic.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The mod will include one character with a full set of unique cards (~75 cards) and around 10 relics inspired by the webcomic Homestuck. The primary unique mechanic of the
character is cards that use DnD-style dice rolls to determine the quantity of effects, such as how much damage an attack does or how much poison it applies. However, since
consistency and planning is such a large part of the game, I will also add ample mechanics that allow you to manipulate the outcomes of these rolls. Examples of this would be
a buff that increases your dice rolls by static amounts, or a card that adds a certain amount to your next dice roll. I am using a framework/tutorial
(https://github.com/Gremious/StS-DefaultModBase/wiki) designed for beginners as the base for this mod, and my work will just be added on top of it.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Basic implementation of all the core mechanics I have planned, perhaps without a completed set of cards.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Everything I have planned (75 cards, 10+ relics) and passable art assets.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

When I finish this mod, I'll probably start working on another similar one. This is something I want to do anyway regardless of the deadline, so if I actually get to this, I'll just add what I have so far to the end of the demo.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The game is written in Java, so I'll need to learn Java. I've already gotten a head start on this project and made a few cards, but I think I still have a lot to learn about
Java. So far, it's a nightmare compared to Python. I've been informed that most languages except Python are like this. A lot of concepts from Python still apply, but I have to
learn new ways to express them. Other than that, I'll also have to get used to working on one large project rather than a bunch of smaller projects. Especially in these early
stages, I have to think of my work now as a foundation for my later work, and try to optimize/simplify it as much as I can.
